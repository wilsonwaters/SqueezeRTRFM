# changelog-section.sh - print the body of one version's section of CHANGELOG.md, e.g. for the
# release notes of that version.

# Usage: scripts/changelog-section.sh VERSION [FILE]
#   VERSION  e.g. 1.0.0, as written between the brackets of its heading
#   FILE     the changelog (default: CHANGELOG.md at the repository root)
#
# The section starts after the heading "## [VERSION]" (with or without " - YYYY-MM-DD" after it)
# and ends before the next "## " heading or the first link reference definition ("[x]: url")
# at the bottom of the file. The version is compared as a plain string, so its dots match only
# dots. Leading and trailing blank lines are left out.
# Exit codes: 0 the body was printed; 1 no such section, or it is empty (nothing is printed);
# 2 usage error or unreadable file. Needs awk.
