# testbed-lock.sh - mutual exclusion for the single shared LMS test bed, so parallel agents
# don't re-point the plugin link or restart LMS under each other.
# Usage: dev/testbed-lock.sh acquire <owner> [timeout_s=1800]   # waits until free, then takes it
#        dev/testbed-lock.sh release <owner>                    # only the owner can release
#        dev/testbed-lock.sh status
# A lock older than 60 minutes is considered stale and is broken automatically.
# Typical session (always run dev scripts from the MAIN checkout, /home/user/SqueezeRTRFM/dev):
#   dev/testbed-lock.sh acquire O1
#   PLUGIN_SRC=<your-worktree>/RTRFM dev/link-plugin.sh --restart
#   ... verify ...
#   dev/link-plugin.sh --restart          # re-link the main checkout
#   dev/testbed-lock.sh release O1
